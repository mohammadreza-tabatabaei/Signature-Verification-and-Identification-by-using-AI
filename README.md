# Dataset:
I used a dataset that contains 2 folders. One of these folders contains images of original signatures and the other contains images of forgerie signatures.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN and LSTM algorithms.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing original signatures. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.
